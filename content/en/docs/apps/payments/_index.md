# Payments and ModulR CorDapps Pre-alpha

The Payments and ModulR payment rail pre-alpha CorDapps are early release features that allow you to create theoretical and experimental payment solutions in Corda - connecting to real Payment Service Providers (PSPs).

There are likely to be substantial architectural improvements as development of these features accelerate towards commercial readiness. This is an opportunity for early adopters to test these CorDapps and engage with the concepts before investing in a commercial payments solution.

Get started with the [Payments-core CorDapp](payments-core-cordapp).

Checkout the [Modulr payment rail solution](modulr-payment-rail), designed to trial live payments through the Modulr PSP.
