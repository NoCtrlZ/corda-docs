# Reference Applications

Reference Applications allow you to explore new possibilities on Corda - with fully formed features for reference. You can use these custom-made demos, trial solutions, and pre-Alpha features to by-pass development work, allowing you to focus on your vision for your products.

Within the documentation, you will find set-up guides, tips and operational instructions for a growing list of applications made for reference and exploration.

Explore:

* Bank in a box - a complete retail banking concept that can be hosted on a Corda network.
* Payments on Corda - early sight of the possibilities of making payments in and out of a Corda network.
